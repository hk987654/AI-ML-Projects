# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
This repository contains the code for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that utilizes a deep neural network with self-supervised contrastive learning.

What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?
An IDS is a security tool that monitors network activity and system events to identify suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts. There are two main types of IDSs:

Signature-based detection: This method compares network traffic or system events to a database of known attack signatures. If a match is found, the IDS raises an alert about a potential security breach.
Anomaly detection: This method identifies unusual or suspicious activity that deviates from normal behavior. This approach is often combined with other methods to provide a more comprehensive picture of network and system activity.
Why Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning?
Traditional IDS methods often rely on labeled data for training, which can be limited and expensive to acquire. Self-supervised contrastive learning allows the model to learn informative representations from a vast amount of unlabeled data. This can be beneficial for intrusion detection because it allows the model to identify patterns that might not be explicitly labeled as malicious.

Deep Learning Architecture
This IDS employs a fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify network traffic as either normal or malicious. The ANN is trained using the self-supervised contrastive learning approach on unlabeled network traffic data.
